## ðŸ’¬ Firewalls and ACLs (Access Control Lists)

Before starting this practice, it is important to remember that firewalls and ACLs are integral to a robust network security strategy, offering complementary strengths in protecting and managing network traffic. Below we specify a list of their importance:

* **Prevent Unauthorized Access:** Both firewalls and ACLs help in restricting access to the network, ensuring that only authorized users and devices can communicate.
* **Defend Against Cyber Attacks:** By filtering and monitoring traffic, they protect against various types of cyber threats, such as DoS attacks, malware, and unauthorized access attempts.
* **Network Segmentation:** ACLs are particularly important for segmenting the network, which helps in containing breaches and minimizing damage.
* **Compliance and Policy Enforcement:** Firewalls and ACLs ensure that network traffic complies with organizational security policies and regulatory requirements.
* **Performance Optimization:** By prioritizing critical services and blocking unnecessary traffic, both tools help in maintaining optimal network performance.
