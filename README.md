### Configuring Firewall and ACLs for WordPress Security

#### Objective:
To develop practical skills in securing a WordPress installation through the setup of firewalls and ACLs, enhancing the overall security posture against potential threats.

#### Tools Needed:
- **Kali Linux** with VirtualBox: Previously installed.
- **WordPress Site**: Existing installation from previous projects.
- **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**: A user-friendly firewall configuration tool.
- **iptables**: A more advanced tool for setting up ACLs and managing packet filtering.

#### Instructions:

1. **Introduction to Firewalls and ACLs (15 minutes)**
   - **Instructor Explanation**:
     - Provide an overview of what firewalls and ACLs are, including their importance in network security.
     - Explain the differences between UFW and iptables, and when each tool is appropriate to use.
   - **Student Preparation**:
     - Ensure their WordPress and network services are running and accessible.

2. **Installing and Configuring UFW (15 minutes)**
   - **Instructor Demonstration**:
     - Show how to install UFW on Kali Linux using the terminal:
       ```bash
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install ufw
       ```
     - Demonstrate basic UFW commands to enable the firewall, set default policies, allow SSH connections, and allow web traffic to the WordPress site:
       ```bash
       sudo ufw default deny incoming
       sudo ufw default allow outgoing
       sudo ufw allow ssh
       sudo ufw allow http
       sudo ufw allow https
       sudo ufw enable
       ```
   - **Student Action**:
     - Students replicate these steps on their systems, configuring UFW to protect their WordPress installation.

3. **Configuring Advanced Rules with iptables (20 minutes)**
   - **Setup and Explanation**:
     - Briefly explain how iptables works, focusing on chain rules (INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT) and how packets are processed.
     - Discuss the significance of setting granular rules for enhanced security.
   - **Instructor Demonstration and Student Action**:
     - Guide students to add specific iptables rules to further secure the WordPress server, such as blocking specific IP addresses or dropping packets to unused ports:
       ```bash
       sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
       sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
       sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
       sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
       ```
     - Students apply these rules, testing their configuration by attempting to access their WordPress site from different scenarios (e.g., different network configurations).

4. **Testing and Analysis (10 minutes)**
   - **Simulated Attacks**:
     - Have students simulate network attacks (like pings or unauthorized access attempts) from their own machines or a designated test machine to see if their firewall rules are effective.
   - **Review and Feedback**:
     - Discuss the outcomes with students, reviewing which firewall rules were effective and which were not.

#### Closure and Reflective Discussion (10 minutes)
- Facilitate a discussion on the importance of firewalls and ACLs in real-world scenarios.
- Encourage students to reflect on how these security measures can be implemented in different environments and the potential challenges they might face.

This project will help students gain a solid understanding of basic and advanced firewall configurations, as well as hands-on experience in securing a web application environment effectively.
